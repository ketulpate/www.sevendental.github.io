                <h2>Meet Dr Gustavo Fischer</h2>
                <h5>Principal Dentist</h5>
                <p>“My father was a dentist, and I remember being fascinated with the equipment and little bottles at the practice.” That fascination led Dr Gus, our Principal Dentist, to pursue a career in a field that allows him to change patients’ lives for good.
                    An Interest in Biological Dentistry
                    Dr Gus prioritises his holistic dental philosophy with a keen interest in biocompatible materials, minimally invasive treatment techniques, fluoride-free alternatives to caries management, safe mercury fillings replacement and all treatment approaches that biological dentistry has to offer. Please also remove the “any invasive or surgical procedure may carry risks. Before moving forward, it is recommended that you seek a second opinion from an appropriately licensed medical professional. 
                    </p><h5>Education and Experience</h5><p>
                    Dr Gus earned his Bachelor of Dental Science with a Specialty in Periodontics from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1992. He also possesses an Australian Dental Council Certificate (BDS ADC).
                    In addition, Dr Gus has more than 25 years of experience in dentistry and is a member of the International Academy of Oral Medicine & Toxicology (IAOMT). His experience also includes 12 years teaching Oral Implants and Periodontics in different universities and postgraduate training institutions.

                    In 2022, Dr Victoria earned a Bachelor of Dental Surgery with Distinction from James Cook University, in Cairns. She also had some placements in Townsville and Mackay.
